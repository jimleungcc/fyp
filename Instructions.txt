1. Use meshlab to find the object ply
2. Run the convertPLYencoding.py in the SAME directory, where the ply files located.
3. Run the combinePLY.py to combine ply files.
4. append to the object_list and also give an object name

5. be aware of the floor point cloud, to see where are some outliers points
6. Check the bounding box point, adjust the index in get_section:
    rect_points.append(sorted_a[4])
    rect_points.append(sorted_a[0])
    rect_points.append(sorted_a[2])
    rect_points.append(sorted_a[6])
